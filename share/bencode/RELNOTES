2012-11-27  RELEASE-2.0.1  Moritz Wilhelmy <moritz@wzff.de>
	The License has been changed to the same terms as Lua, rather than
	public domain.

2012-11-27  RELEASE-2.0  Moritz Wilhelmy <moritz@wzff.de>
	This is the second release of lua-bencode.

	API Changes:
	* Instead of throwing errors all over the place, nil and an error message
	  will be returned in case data can not be decoded or encoded.
	  This means that calls to bencode functions no longer need to be wrapped
	  in pcall(). You will need to check the return value instead.
	  This change affects all users of the library and fixes issue #5.
	  This API change is the reason why the major version number was bumped.

	Fixed bugs:
	* Most importantly, xopxe has reported and fixed a bug which prevented the
	  decoding of negative integers. Thanks! (issue #7)
	* package.seeall is no longer used. (fixes #3)
	* A table is now used for encoding. This way, less garbage is
	  produced. (fixes #6)

	Note:
	* An examples directory has been added. It currently contains a script to
	  prettyprint .torrent files
	* A silly testsuite has been added.

	Caveat:
	* Self- or cross-referencing tables can not be decoded. This was issue #4
	  that came up in the announcement of the original release. It was not
	  deemed utterly important, since people dealing with this kind of tables
	  will probably have to check it anyway. As such, this decision reduces
	  code duplication.

2011-01-22	RELEASE-1
	This is the first release of lua-bencode. It was actually released a bit
	earlier, but this timestamp represents the date it was moved from luaforge.
